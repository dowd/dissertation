This has resulted in footways drawn to connect both highways and the traffic island in positions that I have deemed dangerous and quite arbitrary from my local knowledge. My concerns were met with little reaction when I voiced them but I think this style of mapping would be of particular concern to maps generated to place emphasis on traffic crossings, such as those for the visually impaired. Overall, I felt that the heavily active contributors (that I attempted to voice this to) are dominated more by interests in functional aspects of OSM and less by the form. I'm finding little evidence of contributions prioritising form of map design, and increasing the balance of contributions from this perspective would be welcomed and encourage me to contribute more - both in the general sense and as a result of this, data relevant to visual impairment which I think is something that is a natural subset of subjects I tended to map in Ireland.",

For example, sidewalks are tagged for their existence on one side or both sides of the street,  which is easy input.  However, you'd like to know the path and if there are any obstacles.  The position of those obstacles is of particular importance, and I'm not so sure digitized Bing imagery can give you that level of precision.  3 meters off on OSM is fairly close and generally good enough for mapping, but may not close enough for this application."
