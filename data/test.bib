abstract = {ABSTRACT With the ubiquity of advanced web technologies and location- sensing hand held devices, citizens regardless of their knowledge or expertise, are able to produce spatial information. This phenom- enon is known as volunteered geographic information (VGI). During the past decade VGI has been used as a data source supporting a wide range of services, such as environmental mon- itoring, events reporting, human movement analysis, disaster management, etc. However, these volunteer-contributed data also come with varying quality. Reasons for this are: data is pro- duced by heterogeneous contributors, using various technologies and tools, having different level of details and precision, serving heterogeneous purposes, and a lack of gatekeepers. Crowd-sour- cing, social, and geographic approaches have been proposed and later followed to develop appropriate methods to assess the quality measures and indicators of VGI. In this article, we review various quality measures and indicators for selected types of VGI and existing quality assessment methods. As an outcome, the article presents a classification of VGI with current methods uti- lized to assess the quality of selected types of VGI. Through these findings, we introduce data mining as an additional approach for quality handling in VGI},

abstract = {We travel through the environment to reach places that satisfy our needs and wants. Successful travel requires that we know where to go and how to get there; it also requires that we can move along the intended route in the intended direction without having accidents or getting unnecessarily delayed. Taken together, these are requirements of navigation: coordinated and goal-directed movement through the environment. Navigation occurs over a wide spectrum of spatio-temporal scales. We navigate to the other side of the room, to the post office, to visit our relatives in another town, or to vacation half way around the world. In order to navigate effectively, we apply our psychological skills of perception, cognition, and motor behavior, within the contexts of physical and social environments, and with the assistance of technologies of information and transportation. There are consequently a host of human factors issues relevant to navigation. Attention to these issues can result in improvements to the design of technologies, environments, and training procedures that increase the ease, accuracy, efficiency, comfort, and safety of navigation.},

abstract = {For this first of three progress reports on cartography, I am going to focus upon research into tactile mapping for visually impaired people, published since Fleming's (1990) review. This specialist field is often perceived as marginal to more mainstream cartography; production is often informal and receives no attention in Parry and Perkins (2000), the latest benchmark survey of the state of world mapping. Key themes in the tactile mapping community, however, reflect current concerns in the wider worlds of cartographic research. Six topics are reviewed here. How might spatial understanding differ among visually impaired people, and how might this be linked to map use? How does the 'real-world' practice of tactile map design vary according to context? To what extent has the increasing emphasis on standardization also applied to tactile mapping? How is technological change affecting tactile map production? Are hard-copy tactile representations still relevant in the digital and multimedia age? Finally, given the cultural turn in geography and more critical emphases among historians of cartography, how relevant are ethical issues in tactile map research?},

abstract = {In this article we describe the analysis of 25,000 objects from the OpenStreetMap (OSM) databases of Ireland, United Kingdom, Germany, and Austria. The objects are selected as exhibiting the characteristics of “heavily edited” objects. We consider “heavily edited” objects as having 15 or more versions over the object's lifetime. Our results indicate that there are some serious issues arising from the way contributors tag or annotate objects in OSM. Values assigned to the “name” and “highway” attributes are often subject to frequent and unexpected change. However, this “tag flip-flopping” is not found to be strongly correlated with increasing numbers of contributors. We also show problems with usage of the OSM ontology/controlled vocabularly. The majority of errors occurring were caused by contributors choosing values from the ontology “by hand” and spelling these values incorrectly. These issues could have a potentially detrimental effect on the quality of OSM data while at the same time damaging the perception of OSM in the GIS community. The current state of tagging and annotation in OSM is not perfect. We feel that the problems identified are a combination of the flexibility of the tagging process in OSM and the lack of a strict mechanism for checking adherence to the OSM ontology for specific core attributes. More studies related to comparing the names of features in OSM to recognized ground-truth datasets are required.},

abstract = {Pedestrian behavior and safety at roundabouts are not well understood, particularly for pedestrians with sensory or mobility impairments. A previous study in which participants indicated when they would cross suggested that blind pedestrians miss more crossing opportunities and make riskier judgments than sighted pedestrians. The present study replicated these findings and analyzed actual street crossings. Six blind and six sighted pedestrians negotiated a double-lane urban roundabout under high and low traffic volumes. Blind participants waited three times longer to cross than sighted participants. About 6{\%} of the blind participants' crossing attempts were judged dangerous enough to require intervention, compared to none for sighted pedestrians. Drivers yielded frequently on the entry lanes but not the exit lanes. Sighted participants accepted drivers' yields, whereas blind participants rarely did so. Blind-sighted differences are interpreted in terms of auditory access to information about traffic, and policy implications are discussed regarding accessibility of transportation systems.},

Tactile maps can provide them with spatial knowledge of their environment, thereby reducing fear related to travelling in space. To date, raised-line paper maps have been used to make geographic information accessible, but these paper maps have significant limitations with regards to content and the presentation of information. Recent advances in technology may help to design usable interactive maps that overcome such limitations. In this paper, we first review different accessible map concepts. We then present our design of an interactive map prototype, and provide evidence of this interactive map's high user satisfaction and efficiency as compared to a regular raised-line paper map. To conclude, we suggest that advances in interactive technologies (e.g., haptic touch surfaces) provide a unique opportunity to design usable maps in the near future.},

abstract = {Sighted people often have the best of intentions when they want to help a blind person navigate, but their well meaning is also often coupled with a lack of knowledge and understanding about how a person navigates without vision. As a result what sighted people think is the right feedback is too often the wrong feedback to give to a person with a visual impairment. Understanding how to provide feedback to blind navigators is crucial to the design of assistive technologies for navigation. In our research investigating the design of a personal pedestrian navigation device, we observed firsthand the ways that sighted people seemingly misunderstand how many blind people navigate when using a white cane mobility aid. Throughout our qualitative end user studies that included focus groups and observations (including couple-based observations with a close companion) we gathered data that explicitly shows how the language and understanding of sighted vs. blind pedestrians differs greatly and even how it can be dangerous when people interfere in the wrong way. From our findings we discuss why it is difficult for a blind person to navigate like a sighted person to ensure designers are aware of the difficulties and designing with new training in mind, not simply designing from their own point of view. We also want to encourage advocacy and empathy amongst the sighted community towards this activity of walking around independently.},

abstract = {This article describes results from a research project undertaken to explore the technical issues associated with integrating unstructured crowd sourced data with authoritative national mapping data. The ultimate objective is to develop methodologies to ensure the feature enrichment of authoritative data, using crowd sourced data. Users increasingly find that they wish to use data from both kinds of geographic data sources. Different techniques and methodologies can be developed to solve this problem. In our previous research, a position map matching algorithm was developed for integrating authoritative and crowd sourced road vector data, and showed promising results (Anand et al. 2010). However, especially when integrating different forms of data at the feature level, these techniques are often time consuming and are more computationally intensive than other techniques available. To tackle these problems, this project aims at developing a methodology for automated conflict resolution, linking and merging of geographical information from disparate authoritative and crowd-sourced data sources. This article describes research undertaken by the authors on the design, implementation, and evaluation of algorithms and procedures for producing a coherent ontology from disparate geospatial data sources. To integrate road vector data from disparate sources, the method presented in this article first converts input data sets to ontologies, and then merges these ontologies into a new ontology. This new ontology is then checked and modified to ensure that it is consistent. The developed methodology can deal with topological and geometry inconsistency and provide more flexibility for geospatial information merging.},

We test the components of a system that is able to provide blindfolded users with information about location via tactile feedback. We assess the accuracy of vision-based localisation by making comparisons with estimates of location derived from both a recent SLAM-based algorithm and from indoor surveying equipment. We evaluate the precision and reliability by which location information can be conveyed to human subjects by analysing their ability to infer position from electrostatic feedback in the form of textural (haptic) cues on a tablet device. Finally, we describe a relatively lightweight systems architecture that enables images to be captured and location results to be served back to the haptic device based on journey information from multiple users and devices.},

abstract = {The use of spatial (geographic) information is becoming ever more central and pervasive in today's internet society but the most of it is currently inaccessible to visually impaired users. However, access in visual maps is severely restricted to visually impaired and people with blindness, due to their inability to interpret graphical information. Thus, alternative ways of a map's presentation have to be explored, in order to enforce the accessibility of maps. Multiple types of sensory perception like touch and hearing may work as a substitute of vision for the exploration of maps. The use of multimodal virtual environments seems to be a promising alternative for people with visual impairments. The present paper introduces a tool for automatic multimodal map generation having haptic and audio feedback using OpenStreetMap data. For a desired map area, an elevation map is being automatically generated and can be explored by touch, using a haptic device. A sonification and a text-to-speech (TTS) mechanism provide also audio navigation information during the haptic exploration of the map.},

To explore the potential impacts of such technology, we conducted two studies. The first was an online survey that included 114 participants with visual impairments and 101 sighted participants; we compare the two groups in terms of current device use. The second was an interview and design probe study with 10 participants with visual impairments. Our findings expand on past work to characterize a range of trends in smartphone use and accessibility issues therein. Participants with visual impairments also responded positively to two eyes-free wearable device scenarios: a wristband or ring and a glasses-based device.

As one might expect, the performance of blind individuals in many behaviours and tasks requiring imagery can be inferior to that of sighted subjects; however, surprisingly often this is not the case. Interestingly, there is evidence that the blind often employ different cognitive mechanisms than sighted subjects, suggesting that compensatory mechanisms can overcome the limitations of sight loss. Taken together, these studies suggest that the nature of perceptual input on which we commonly rely strongly affects the organization of our mental processes. We also review recent neuroimaging studies on the neural correlates of sensory perception and mental imagery in visually impaired individuals that have cast light on the plastic functional reorganization mechanisms associated with visual deprivation.},

Even blind or visual impaired people are used to modern phones. With assisted technologies like VoiceOver or Talkback, blind people are not reliant on phones with haptic/touchable keys. A lot of effort was made to improve the positioning indoor and outdoors, but affordable technologies are not accurate enough to navigate blind persons on a safe trip. The positioning should be improved by telling the user the surrounding environment. In example the user can verify the position of the sidewalk by telling him the location of the street and the buildings. The goal is the selection of a routing maschine which can deliver a safe route and additional trip information (i.e. crossings with acoustic traffic lights).},

abstract = {Social innovations are solutions to challenges that the market or public sector have not been able to solve adequately. Open data has been recognized to offer significant opportunities for developing new products and services. This potential can be especially significant for developing social innovations, for which the use of proprietary data may be limited due to cost and licensing issues. This article proposes an analytical framework for examining the management and coordination of social innovation activities that use open data for developing digital applications. The purpose of the analytical framework is to help researchers to identify the key actors and their contributions in the different stages of the social innovation process. The framework also helps researchers and originators of open data to appreciate the role of open data as an enabler of social innovation.},

@article{Chandler2013,
abstract = {Previous research has highlighted that blind and partially sighted people find various factors inhibit their abilities to make journeys. This paper proposes that the lack of accurate, appropriate and usable geographical data is one of the reasons for this and these can be tracked back to core human factors issues such as situational awareness, mental workload and environmental ergonomics. Following a review of applicable literature a hierarchical task analysis was performed to better understand the problems in terms of the complexity of various journey types and to identify the geographical data requirements in order to make successful journeys. The task analysis produced a number of results including highlighting four underlying principles which have an impact on the data requirements during any given journey. Finally the need for accessible and accurate geographical data requirements is introduced as a result of the literature review and the task analysis. These highlight the information required in order to facilitate more accessible travel for blind and partially sighted people by providing geographical information about their surroundings in a relevant, meaningful and usable way. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd and The Ergonomics Society.},

abstract = {The long-term objective of our project is to discover the fundamental principles underlying the collaborative production, sharing, and management of route information by travelers with visual impairments. The specific research hypothesis is two-fold: 1) people with varied levels of vision loss and orientation and mobility (O{\&}M) skills will be able to form online social networks that collaboratively manage large route information collections for different geographic areas, and 2) members of such networks will be able to successfully travel through a variety of previously unknown indoor and outdoor environments of varied complexity when provided with online verbal route directions referencing landmarks and path integration information salient to their particular vision and skill level. In this paper, we report on the initial stage of our project: an online survey whose objectives are to collect samples of route descriptions from travelers with visual impairments and to do the initial profiling of the target population. The data collected so far provide valuable insights into what travelers with visual impairments need to know about their environments in order to travel independently and how they may communicate that information to their fellow travelers in the future.
