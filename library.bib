abstract = {The concept of Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI) has recently emerged from the new Web 2.0 technologies. The OpenStreetMap project is currently the most significant example of a system based on VGI. It aims at producing free vector geographic databases using contributions from Internet users. Spatial data quality becomes a key consideration in this context of freely downloadable geographic databases. This article studies the quality of French OpenStreetMap data. It extends the work of Haklay to France, provides a larger set of spatial data quality element assessments (i.e. geometric, attribute, semantic and temporal accuracy, logical con- sistency, completeness, lineage, and usage), and uses different methods of quality control. The outcome of the study raises questions such as the heterogeneity of processes, scales of production, and the compliance to standardized and accepted specifications. In order to improve data quality, a balance has to be struck between the contributors' freedom and their respect of specifications. The development of appropriate solutions to provide this balance is an important research issue in the domain of user-generated content.},

abstract = {The OpenStreetMap (OSM) project, founded in 2004, has gathered an exceptional amount of interest in recent years and counts as one of the most impressive sources of Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI) on the Internet. In total, more than half a million members had registered for the project by the end of 2011. However, while this number of contributors seems impressive, questions remain about the individual contributions that have been made by the project members. This research article contains several studies regarding the contributions by the community of the project. The results show that only 38{\%} (192,000) of the registered members carried out at least one edit in the OSM database and that only 5{\%} (24,000) of all members actively contributed to the project in a more productive way. The majority of the members are located in Europe (72{\%}) and each member has an activity area whose size may range from one soccer field up to more than 50 km2. In addition to several more analyses conducted for this article, predictions will be made about how this newly acquired knowledge can be used for future research.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Epidemiologists and ecologists often collect data in the field and, on returning to their laboratory, enter their data into a database for further analysis. The recent introduction of mobile phones that utilise the open source Android operating system, and which include (among other features) both GPS and Google Maps, provide new opportunities for developing mobile phone applications, which in conjunction with web applications, allow two-way communication between field workers and their project databases.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODOLOGY: Here we describe a generic framework, consisting of mobile phone software, EpiCollect, and a web application located within www.spatialepidemiology.net. Data collected by multiple field workers can be submitted by phone, together with GPS data, to a common web database and can be displayed and analysed, along with previously collected data, using Google Maps (or Google Earth). Similarly, data from the web database can be requested and displayed on the mobile phone, again using Google Maps. Data filtering options allow the display of data submitted by the individual field workers or, for example, those data within certain values of a measured variable or a time period.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Data collection frameworks utilising mobile phones with data submission to and from central databases are widely applicable and can give a field worker similar display and analysis tools on their mobile phone that they would have if viewing the data in their laboratory via the web. We demonstrate their utility for epidemiological data collection and display, and briefly discuss their application in ecological and community data collection. Furthermore, such frameworks offer great potential for recruiting 'citizen scientists' to contribute data easily to central databases through their mobile phone.},

abstract = {The growing availability of spatial data along with growing ease to use the spatial data (thanks to wide-scale adoption of GIS) have made it possible to use spatial data in applications inappropriate considering the quality of the data. As a result, concerns about spatial data quality have increased. To deal with these concerns, it is necessary to (1) formalise and standardise descriptions of spatial data quality and (2) to apply these descriptions in assessing the suitability (fitness for use) of spatial data, before using the data. The aim of this thesis was twofold: (1) to enhance the description of spatial data quality and (2) to improve our understanding of the implications of spatial data quality. Chapter 1 sets the scene with a discussion on uncertainty and an explanation of why concerns about spatial data quality exist. Knowledge gaps are identified and the chapter concludes with six research questions. Chapter 2 presents an overview of definitions of spatial data quality. Overall, I found a strong agreement on which elements together define spatial data quality. Definitions appear to differ in two aspects: (1) the location within the meta-data report: some elements occur not in the spatial data quality section but in another section of the meta-data report; and (2) the explicitness with which elements are recognised as individual elements. For example, the European pre-standard explicitly recognises the element ‘homogeneity'. Other standards recognise the importance of documenting the variation in quality, without naming it explicitly as an individual element. In chapter 3 we quantified the spatial variability in classification accuracy for the agricultural crops in the Dutch national land cover database (LGN). Classification accuracy was significantly correlated with: (1) the crop present according to LGN, (2) the homogeneity of the 8-cell neighbourhood around each cell, (3) the size of the patch in which a cell is located, and (4) the heterogeneity of the landscape in which a cell is located. In chapter 4 I present methods that use error matrices and change detection error matrices as input to make more accurate land cover change estimates. It was shown that temporal correlation in classification errors has a significant impact and must be taken into account. Producers of time series land cover data are recommended not only to report error matrices, but also change detection error matrices. Chapter 5 focuses on positional accuracy and area estimates. From the positional accuracy of vertices delineating polygons, the variance and covariance in area can be derived. Earlier studies derived equations for the variance, this chapter presents a covariance equation. The variance and covariance equation were implemented in a model and applied in a case-study. The case-study consisted of 97 polygons with a small subsidy value (in euros per hectare) assigned to each polygon. With the model we could calculate the uncertainty in the total subsidy value (in euros) of the complete set of polygons as a consequence of uncertainty in the position of vertices. Chapter 6 explores the relationship between completeness of spatial data and risk in digging activities around underground cables and pipelines. A model is presented for calculating the economic implications of over- and incompleteness. An important element of this model is the relationship between detection time and costs. The model can be used to calculate the optimal detection time, i.e. the time at which expected costs are at their minimum. Chapter 7 addresses the question why risk analysis (RA) is so rarely applied to assess the suitability of spatial data prior to using the data. In theory, the use of RA is beneficial because it allows the user to judge if the use of certain spatial data does not produce unacceptable risks. Frequently proposed hypotheses explaining the scarce adoption of RA are all technical and educational. In chapter 7 we propose a new group of hypotheses, based on decision theory. We found that the willingness to spend resources on RA depends (1) on the presence of feedback mechanisms in the decision- making process, (2) on how much is at stake and (3) to a minor extent on how well the decision-making process can be modelled. Chapter 8 presents conclusions on the six research questions (chapters 2-7) and lists recommendations for users, producers and researchers of spatial data. With regard to the description, four recommendations are given. Firstly, spend more effort on documenting the lineage of reference data. Secondly, quantify and report correlation of quality between related data sets. Thirdly, investigate the integration of different forms of uncertainty (error, vagueness, ambiguity). Fourthly, study the implementation and use of spatial data quality standards. With regard to the application of spatial data quality descriptions, I have two main recommendations. Firstly, to continue the line of research followed in this thesis: quantification of implications of spatial data quality, through development of theory along with tangible illustrations in case-studies. Secondly, there is a need for more empirical research into how users cope with spatial data quality.},

@article{Haklay2010,
abstract = {Within the framework of Web 2.0 mapping applications, the most striking example of a geographical application is the OpenStreetMap (OSM) project. OSM aims to create a free digital map of the world and is implemented through the engagement of participants in a mode similar to software development in Open Source projects. The information is collected by many participants, collated on a central database, and distributed in multiple digital formats through the World Wide Web. This type of information was termed 'Volunteered Geographical Information' (VG!) by Goodchild, 2007. However, to date there has been no systematic analysis of the quality of VGI. This study aims to fill this gap by analysing OSM information. The examination focuses on analysis of its quality through a comparison with Ordnance Survey (OS) datasets. The analysis focuses on London and England, since OSM started in London in August 2004 and therefore the study of these geographies provides the best understanding of the achievements and difficulties of VGI. The analysis shows that OSM information can be fairly accurate: on average within about 6 m of the position recorded by the OS, and with approximately 80{\%} overlap of motorway objects between the two datasets. In the space of four years, OSM has captured about 29{\%} of the area of England, of which approximately 24{\%} are digitised lines without a complete set of attributes. The paper concludes with a discussion of the implications of the findings to the study of VGI as well as suggesting future research directions.},

abstract = {Geospatial data users increasingly face the need to assess how datasets fit an intended use. However, information describing data quality is typically difficult to access and understand. Therefore, data quality is often neglected by users, leading to risks of misuse. Understanding data quality is a complex task that may involve thousands of partially related metadata. For complex cases where heterogeneous datasets have to be integrated, there is a need for tools supporting data quality analysis. This paper presents the design of such a tool that can manage heterogeneous data quality information and provide functions to support expert users in the assessment of the fitness for use of a given dataset. Combining concepts from GIS and Business Intelligence, this approach provides interactive, multi-granularity and context-sensitive spatial data quality indicators that help experts to build and justify their opinions. A prototype called the Multidimensional User Manual is presented to illustrate this approach.},

The IcEentifcation of local patterns of spatial assocktion is an important concern in this respect. In this paper, I outline a new general class of local indicators of spatial association (LISA) and show how they allow for the decomposition of global indicators, such as Moran's I, into the contribution of each observation. The LISA statistics serve two purposes. On one hand, they may be interpreted as indicators of local pockets of nonstationarity, or hot spots, similar to the Gi and G: statistics of Getis and Ord (1992). On the other hand, they may be used to assess the influence of individual locations on the magnitude of the global statistic and to identifiy “outliers,” as in Anselin's Moran scatterplot (1993a). An initial eualuation of the properties of a LISA statistic is carried out for the local Moran, which is applied in a study of the spatial pattern of confict for African countries and in a number of Monte Carlo simulations.},

The heterogeneous environment, easily perceived by visually enabled people, is hardly known by partially sighted people. A challenging task for these people is independent navigation in new spaces/buildings/environments. The environment is usually signaled and labeled with visual marks and signs which are not appropriate for blind persons. With the purpose of balancing the access to services and spaces among all persons, this work proposes an innovative navigation and information system to help the navigation of blind people within new environments (e.g. shopping center, public office building). Based on smartphones and wireless sensors deployed in the environment, we propose an information tracking system for realtime guide blind people (BlindeDroid). It offers guided navigation, answering questions, and providing objective information about places, products and services that are available surrounding the user.},

abstract = {Previously, we have described the development of the generic mobile phone data gathering tool, EpiCollect, and an associated web application, providing two-way communication between multiple data gatherers and a project database. This software only allows data collection on the phone using a single questionnaire form that is tailored to the needs of the user (including a single GPS point and photo per entry), whereas many applications require a more complex structure, allowing users to link a series of forms in a linear or branching hierarchy, along with the addition of any number of media types accessible from smartphones and/or tablet devices (e.g., GPS, photos, videos, sound clips and barcode scanning). A much enhanced version of EpiCollect has been developed (EpiCollect+). The individual data collection forms in EpiCollect+ provide more design complexity than the single form used in EpiCollect, and the software allows the generation of complex data collection projects through the ability to link many forms together in a linear (or branching) hierarchy. Furthermore, EpiCollect+ allows the collection of multiple media types as well as standard text fields, increased data validation and form logic. The entire process of setting up a complex mobile phone data collection project to the specification of a user (project and form definitions) can be undertaken at the EpiCollect+ website using a simple 'drag and drop' procedure, with visualisation of the data gathered using Google Maps and charts at the project website. EpiCollect+ is suitable for situations where multiple users transmit complex data by mobile phone (or other Android devices) to a single project web database and is already being used for a range of field projects, particularly public health projects in sub-Saharan Africa. However, many uses can be envisaged from education, ecology and epidemiology to citizen science.},

abstract = {Haptics is a feedback technology that takes advantage of the human sense of touch by applying forces, vibrations, and/or motions to a haptic-enabled user device such as a mobile phone. In this paper we describe four haptic feedback-based prototypes for pedestrian navigation. Haptics is used to convey location, orientation, and distance information to users using pedestrian navigation applications. We compare the functionalities of four applications of haptics in such applications. Initial user trials have elicited positive responses from the users who see benefit in being provided with a "heads up" approach to mobile navigation.},

abstract = {Google Street View provides a valuable and efficient alternative to observe the physical environment compared to on-site fieldwork. However, studies on the use, reliability and validity of Google Street View in a cycling-to-school context are lacking. We aimed to study the intra-, inter-rater reliability and criterion validity of EGA-Cycling (E nvironmental G oogle Street View Based A udit - Cycling to school), a newly developed audit using Google Street View to assess the physical environment along cycling routes to school. Parents (n = 52) of 11-to-12-year old Flemish children, who mostly cycled to school, completed a questionnaire and identified their child's cycling route to school on a street map. Fifty cycling routes of 11-to-12-year olds were identified and physical environmental characteristics along the identified routes were rated with EGA-Cycling (5 subscales; 37 items), based on Google Street View. To assess reliability, two researchers performed the audit. Criterion validity of the audit was examined by comparing the ratings based on Google Street View with ratings through on-site assessments. Intra-rater reliability was high (kappa range 0.47-1.00). Large variations in the inter-rater reliability (kappa range -0.03-1.00) and criterion validity scores (kappa range -0.06-1.00) were reported, with acceptable inter-rater reliability values for 43{\%} of all items and acceptable criterion validity for 54{\%} of all items. EGA-Cycling can be used to assess physical environmental characteristics along cycling routes to school. However, to assess the micro-environment specifically related to cycling, on-site assessments have to be added.},

Based on a wide literature review of motivation, open source, volunteerism, and serious leisure, a questionnaire was created and completed by 444 OpenStreetMap contributors. Results of judgments of the motivational importance of 39 reasons for contribution are presented and considered in relation to models of contributory behavior for crowd- and community-based online collaborations. Positive and important motivators were found that accorded with ideas of the “personal but shared need” associated with contribution to open-source projects, co-orientation to open-source and geographic knowledge, and attention to participation in and by the community. Differences in motivation between serious and casual mappers showed that serious mappers were more oriented to community, learning, local knowledge, and career motivations (although the latter motivation is low in general), and casual mappers were more oriented to general principles of free availability of mapping data.},

All three aspects (users, elements, and contributions) demonstrate striking power laws or heavy-tailed distributions. The heavy-tailed distributions imply that there are far more small elements than large ones, far more inactive users than active ones, and far more lightly edited elements than heavy-edited ones. Furthermore, about 500 users in the core group of the OSM are highly networked in terms of collaboration.},

The bases for quality management of reference geo-information are discussed using three viewpoints; data, process and organization and user centric viewpoints. These viewpoints can be met using ISO 19157 and ISO 19158 standards together with ESDIN developed Quality Model and Data Quality Services Framework (DQSF). Two different services are identified a Data Quality Web Service and a Data User Web Service. We discuss how these principles and services are implemented now within EuroGeographics and Ordnance Survey of Great Britain. Further development will be done during the European Location Framework (ELF) project, which is providing a single source of reference geo-information for Europe during 2013-2016.},

SMEs are said to be the lifeblood of any vibrant economy. They are known to be the silent drivers of a nation's economy. SMEs of India are one of the most aggressive adopters of ERP Packages. Most of the Indian SMEs have adopted the traditional ERP Systems and have incurred a heavy cost while implementing these systems. This paper presents the cost savings and reduction in the level of difficulty in adopting a cloud computing Service (CCS) enabled ERP system. For the study, IT people from 30 North Indian SMEs were interviewed. In the cloud computing environment the SMEs will not have to own the infrastructure so they can abstain from any capital expenditure and instead they can utilize the resources as a service and pay as per their usage. We consider the results of the paper to be supportive to our proposed research concept.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: One of the more common behavioral manifestations of dementia-related disorders is severe problems with out-of-home mobility. Various efforts have been attempted to attain a better understanding of mobility behavior, but most studies are based on institutionalized patients and the assessment usually relies on reports of caregivers and institutional staff, using observational approaches, activity monitoring, or behavioral checklists. The current manuscript describes the research protocol of a project that measures mobility in Alzheimer's disease and related cognitive disorders in an innovative way, by taking advantage of advanced tracking technologies.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS/DESIGN: Participants are 360 demented persons, mildly cognitively impaired persons, and unimpaired controls aged {\textgreater} or = 65 in Israel and Germany. Data regarding space-time activities will be collected via a GPS tracking kit for a period of 4 weeks in 3 waves (one year apart) with the same participants (using a repeated measures design). Participants will be interviewed by use of a battery of instruments prior to and following GPS data collection. Further, a family member will complete a questionnaire both before and after data tracking. Statistical analyses will strive to explain differences in mobility based on a wide range of socio-structural, clinical, affect-related and environmental variables. We will also assess the impact of the use of advanced tracking technology on the quality of life of dementia patients and care givers, as well as its potential as a diagnostic tool. Systematic assessment of ethical issues involved in the use of tracking technology will be an integral component of the project.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nDISCUSSION: This project will be able to make a substantial contribution to basic as well as applied and clinical aspects in the area of mobility and cognitive impairment research. The innovative technologies applied in this study will allow for assessing a range of dimensions of out-of-home mobility, and provide better quality data.},

abstract = {Crowd-mapping is a form of collaborative work that empow- ers citizens to collect and share geographic knowledge. Open- StreetMap (OSM) is a successful example of such paradigm, where the goal of building and maintaining an accurate global map of the changing world is being accomplished by means of local contributions made by over 1.2M citizens. While OSM has been subject to many country-specific studies, the relationship between national culture and economic affluence and users' participation has been so far unexplored. In this work, we systematically study the link between them: we characterise OSM users in terms of who they are, how they contribute, during what period of time, and across what ge- ographic areas. We find strong correlations between these characteristics and national culture factors (e.g., power dis- tance, individualism, pace of life, self expression), and well as Gross Domestic Product per capita. Based on these findings, we discuss design issues that developers of crowd-mapping services should consider to account for cross-cultural differ- ences.},

abstract = {Sighted people often have the best of intentions when they want to help a blind person navigate, but their well meaning is also often coupled with a lack of knowledge and understanding about how a person navigates without vision. As a result what sighted people think is the right feedback is too often the wrong feedback to give to a person with a visual impairment. Understanding how to provide feedback to blind navigators is crucial to the design of assistive technologies for navigation. In our research investigating the design of a personal pedestrian navigation device, we observed firsthand the ways that sighted people seemingly misunderstand how many blind people navigate when using a white cane mobility aid. Throughout our qualitative end user studies that included focus groups and observations (including couple-based observations with a close companion) we gathered data that explicitly shows how the language and understanding of sighted vs. blind pedestrians differs greatly and even how it can be dangerous when people interfere in the wrong way. From our findings we discuss why it is difficult for a blind person to navigate like a sighted person to ensure designers are aware of the difficulties and designing with new training in mind, not simply designing from their own point of view. We also want to encourage advocacy and empathy amongst the sighted community towards this activity of walking around independently.},

This requires the identification of ways to overcome the barriers to access for those who are socially excluded. In order to address these issues, a software tool, AMELIA (A Methodology for Enhancing Life by Increasing Accessibility), is being developed to test the extent to which transport policies can increase social inclusion. This is part of a research project being carried out as part of a large programme looking at ‘Accessibility and User Needs in Transport in a Sustainable Urban Environment'. AMELIA will be used to investigate how many more people are able to reach various opportunities, including shops, medical and welfare centres, employment and leisure facilities. It will be used to establish how many people meet accessibility benchmarks defined elsewhere in the project with and without the policy intervention. Micro-level data based upon street audits have been collected for the city of St Albans in Hertfordshire, including details such as steps, slopes, access to individual buildings, and obstructions on the pavement. In this paper, the effect of removing barriers to movement on the street is discussed because, by doing so, streets can be made more liveable},

Both the historical basis of the field and a broad selection of current work are summarized. Reinforcement learning is the problem faced by an agent that learns behavior though trial and error interactions with a dynamic environment. The work described here has a resemblance to work in psychology, but differs considerably in the details and in the use of the word "reinforcement." The paper discusses central issues of reinforcement learning, including trading off exploration and exploitation, establishing the foundations of the field via Markov decision theory, learning from delayed reinforcement, deconstructing empirical models to accelerate learning, making use of generalization and hierarchy, and coping with hidden state. It concludes with a survey of some implemented systems and an assessment of the practical utility of current methods of reinforcement learning.},

abstract = {The generation of a routing network for disabled people inherits a number of prerequisites that need special consideration. Widespread routing applications that rely on commercial or governmental geodata sources are not feasible for this specific task, due to the lack of detailed information about features such as sidewalks, surface conditions or road incline. In recent years the research community has experienced a strong increase in studies related to routing applications tailored to disabled people in which the lack of a sophisticated dataset played a major role. This study proposes an algorithm for the generation of a disabled people friendly routing network, based on collaboratively collected geodata provided by the OpenStreetMap (OSM) project. This new representation of a routing graph can be used in numerous applications and maps dedicated to people with disabilities. The algorithm is tested and evaluated for selected areas in Europe, resulting in newly generated extended networks that include sidewalk information. The results have shown that the success of the final implementation of the introduced algorithm depends highly on the attribute quality of the OSM dataset. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

Many of these changes in the user experience deal with the quality of the data that is being produced and presented to the user, and has led to a wide rang- ing discussion of data quality and the seeming lack of quality as- surance policies and protocols by Apple. These are widely docu- mented in web postings. However, equally important are significant changes in the manner in which the data is presented to the user, but, surprisingly, not much attention has been paid to this aspect of the user experience which is somewhat analogous to the concept of the “last mile” when discussing the bandwidth of communications networks and its associated costs. The changes in the presentation and in the amount of data that are presented to the user on the Ap- ple mapping platform, with an emphasis on mobile devices with a small form factor such as smartphones, are tabulated and compared along with other mapping platforms such as the iOS apps of ESRI, MapQuest, and OpenSeaMap (using the open source map data of OpenStreetMap), as well as Bing Maps and Nokia Maps for which no iOS app exists and thus the corresponding mobile web versions are used.},

@article{Budhathoki2010,
abstract = {This dissertation examines volunteered geographic information (VGI), a Web 2.0 phenomenon in which users contribute geographic information online and collaboratively create maps. By examining the case of www.openstreetmap.org, I clarify why people contribute geographic information to an online community and offer a framework for researching different aspects of the phenomenon. I also outline its implications for expert-oriented production and propose a hybrid model for spatial data infrastructure. I find this topic interesting particularly because it defies the traditional mode and offers a new mode of production and use of geographic information. The dissertation uses a combination of qualitative and quantitative methods of inquiry. I analyzed about 3,000 archived text messages (user conversations called ‘talk-pages' in OpenStreetMap) and contributions from about 34,000 users between 2004 and 2009. I then conducted a survey to reach globally distributed contributors and tested a set of hypotheses regarding their underlying motives for contributing to VGI. I find that an individual's local knowledge about geospatial situations is the most significant motivation. When they see that the areas they care about are blank or erroneously mapped, this invokes the instrumentality of their local knowledge. Individuals realize that they are in possession of knowledge about the areas they live and travel, and they are better positioned to update and correct maps than remote agencies. This realization brings their self-efficacy into play and drives them into mapping. For the contributors of an online geographic information community, the map is a way to manifest their identity and a means of representation in cyberspace. In addition to the instrumentality of local knowledge, I find that self view and monetary motivations have a positive effect on a contributor's likelihood to be a serious mapper (i.e., contribute much more than average contributors). This challenges the speculative and anecdotal claim that altruism is the primary motivation in VGI. In addition to geographic information, the findings of this dissertation have implications for the development of other online communities, local and regional planning, and governance and citizen participation. People's desire to contribute local knowledge should not be understood in limited terms of the geometric primitives of point, line, and polygon; rather, it should be interpreted as an expression of a desire to participate in the broad processes of social, cultural, and technological transformation. If this excitement can be tapped, it will set a new stage for participatory discourse with government and fellow citizens. The resulting collective intelligence might prove to be an asset for transforming 21st century societies.},

The approach first detects and segments texts from a map image and recreates the remaining graphical parts in a tactile form which can be reproduced immediately through a tactile printer. Then, it generates an SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) file, which integrates both text and graphical information. The tactile hardcopy and the SVG file together are used to provide a user with interactive access to the map image through a touchpad, resulting in a tactile-audio representation of the original input image. This supports real-time access to the map without tedious conversion by a sighted professional. Evaluations with six users who are blind show that the created tactile-audio maps from our prototype system convey the most important map information and are deemed as potentially useful for local navigation.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}The evaluation of VGI quality has been a very interesting and popular issue amongst academics and researchers. Various metrics and indicators have been proposed for evaluating VGI quality elements. Various efforts have focused on the use of well-established methodologies for the evaluation of VGI quality elements against authoritative data. In this paper, a number of research papers have been reviewed and summarized in a detailed report on measures for each spatial data quality element. Emphasis is given on the methodology followed and the data used in order to assess and evaluate the quality of the VGI datasets. However, as the use of authoritative data is not always possible many researchers have turned their focus on the analysis of new quality indicators that can function as proxies for the understanding of VGI quality. In this paper, the difficulties in using authoritative datasets are briefly presented and new proposed quality indicators are discussed, as recorded through the literature review. We classify theses new indicators in four main categories that relate with: i) data, ii) demographics, iii) socio-economic situation and iv) contributors. This paper presents a dense, yet comprehensive overview of the research on this field and provides the basis for the ongoing academic effort to create a practical quality evaluation method through the use of appropriate quality indicators.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {High availability and diversity make Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI) an interesting source of information for an increasing number of use cases. Varying quality, however, is a concern often raised when it comes to using VGI in professional applications. Recent research directs towards the esti-mation of VGI quality through the notion of trust as a proxy measure. In this chapter, we investigate which indicators influence trust, focusing on inherent properties that do not require any comparison with a ground truth dataset. The indicators are tested on a sample dataset extracted from OpenStreetMap. High numbers of contributors, versions and confirmations are considered as positive indicators, while corrections and revisions are treated as indicators that have a negative influence on the development of feature trustworthiness. In order to evaluate the trust measure, its results have been compared to the results of a quality measure obtained from a field survey. The quality measure is based on thematic accuracy, topological consistency, and information completeness. To address information completeness as a criterion of data quality, the importance of individual tags for a given feature type was determined based on a method adopted from information retrieval. The results of the comparison between trust assess-ments and quality measure show significant support for the hypothesis that feature-level VGI data quality can be assessed using a trust model based on data provenance.},

As society has concerned itself more$\backslash$nwith problems of dealing with the blind, the physically handicapped,$\backslash$nthe retarded, the deaf, the socio-economically destitute and homeless,$\backslash$nand other special populations, the discipline of geography has dragged$\backslash$nits feet in terms of examining how its expertise can be used to help$\backslash$nunderstand and solve the many problems these special populations$\backslash$nencounter in normal commerce with physical and built environments.$\backslash$nIn this paper I outline some general and some specific suggestions$\backslash$nregarding the way geographers can invoke their skills and knowledge$\backslash$nto deal with sets of problems faced by these special populations.$\backslash$nThe paper is designed to make suggestions both for instructional$\backslash$npurposes (i.e., providing a sufficiently wide topical coverage for$\backslash$npotential course-work in the area), and to identify specific future$\backslash$nresearch challenges. The combined effect is to suggest that geographical$\backslash$nstudy of the disabled could represent a new systematic area of geographic$\backslash$nconcentration that would combine micro and macro approaches, and$\backslash$nfacilitate the development of new geographic theory, methods, and$\backslash$napplications.},

abstract = {Utilizing both Assisted GPS (A-GPS) techniques and new high-sensitivity embedded GPS hardware, mobile phones are now able to achieve positioning in harsh environments such as urban canyons and indoor locations where older embedded GPS chips could not. This paper presents an empirical analysis of the positional accuracy of location data gathered using a high-sensitivity GPS-enabled mobile phone. The performance of the mobile phone is compared to that of regular recreational grade GPS receivers. Availability of valid GPS position fixes on the mobile phones tested was consistently close to 100{\%} both outdoors and indoors. During static outdoor testing, positions provided by the mobile phones revealed a median horizontal error of between 5{\textperiodcentered}0 and 8{\textperiodcentered}5 m, substantially larger than those for regular autonomous GPS units by a factor of 2 to 3. Horizontal errors during static indoor testing were larger compared to outdoors, but the difference in accuracy between mobile phones and regular GPS receivers was reduced. Despite the modest performance of A-GPS on mobile phones, testing under various conditions revealed that very large errors are not very common. The maximum horizontal error during outdoor testing never exceeded 30 metres and during indoor testing never exceeded 100 metres. Combined with the relatively consistent availability of valid GPS position fixes under varying conditions, the current study has confirmed the reliability of A-GPS on mobiles phones as a source of location information for a range of different LBS applications.},

abstract = {Background: Research indicates that neighborhood environment characteristics such as physical disorder influence health and health behavior. In-person audit of neighborhood environments is costly and time-consuming. Google Street View may allow auditing of neighborhood environments more easily and at lower cost, but little is known about the feasibility of such data collection. Purpose: To assess the feasibility of using Google Street View to audit neighborhood environments. Methods: This study compared neighborhood measurements coded in 2008 using Street View with neighborhood audit data collected in 2007. The sample included 37 block faces in high-walkability neighborhoods in New York City. Field audit and Street View data were collected for 143 items associated with seven neighborhood environment constructions: aesthetics, physical disorder, pedestrian safety, motorized traffic and parking, infrastructure for active travel, sidewalk amenities, and social and commercial activity. To measure concordance between field audit and Street View data, percentage agreement was used for categoric measures and Spearman rank-order correlations were used for continuous measures. Results: The analyses, conducted in 2009, found high levels of concordance ({\textless}80{\%} agreement or {\textless}0.60 Spearman rank-order correlation) for 54.3{\%} of the items. Measures of pedestrian safety, motorized traffic and parking, and infrastructure for active travel had relatively high levels of concordance, whereas measures of physical disorder had low levels. Features that are small or that typically exhibit temporal variability had lower levels of concordance. Conclusions: This exploratory study indicates that Google Street View can be used to audit neighborhood environments. ?? 2011 American Journal of Preventive Medicine.},

We provide a privacy-preserving framework for movement data aggregation based on trajectory generalization in a distributed environment. The proposed solution, based on the differential privacy model and on sketching techniques for efficient data compression, provides a formal data protection safeguard.

abstract = {In recent years, there has been an escalation of orientation and wayfinding technologies and systems for visually impaired people. These technological advancements, however, have not been matched by a suitable investigation of human-computer interaction (e.g. designing navigation aids for people who form different cognitive maps for navigation). The aim of this study is to investigate whether a group of sighted participants and a group of visually impaired participants experience a difference in mental and physical demands when given two different sets of verbal instructions directing them to four landmarks. The content of the first set of instructions was proportioned to route descriptions derived from sighted people, and the second set proportioned to descriptions derived from visually impaired people. The objective assessment involved measuring the time taken by participants to reach landmarks and the number of deviations that occurred. A NASA–Task Load Index questionnaire provided an indication of participants subjective percep tion of workload. The results revealed that instructions formed from visually impaired people resulted in a lower weighted workload score, less minor deviations, and quicker times for visually impaired participants. In con- trast, these instructions were found to cause a higher weighted workload score for sighted participants. The results are discussed in relation to the issue of personalisation of mobile context-aware systems for visually impaired people.},

For people with visual impairments, who do not always need the visual display of a mobile phone, alternative means of eyes-free wearable interaction are particularly appealing. To explore the potential impacts of such technology, we conducted two studies.

The second was an interview and design probe study with 10 participants with visual impairments. Our findings expand on past work to characterize a range of trends in smartphone use and accessibility issues therein. Participants with visual impairments also responded positively to two eyes-free wearable device scenarios: a wristband or ring and a glasses-based device. Discussions on projected use of these devices suggest that small, easily accessible, and discreet wearable input could positively impact the ability of people with visual impairments to access information on the go and to participate in certain social interactions.},

A previous study in which participants indicated when they would cross suggested that blind pedestrians miss more crossing opportunities and make riskier judgments than sighted pedestrians. The present study replicated these findings and analyzed actual street crossings. Six blind and six sighted pedestrians negotiated a double-lane urban roundabout under high and low traffic volumes. Blind participants waited three times longer to cross than sighted participants. About 6{\%} of the blind participants' crossing attempts were judged dangerous enough to require intervention, compared to none for sighted pedestrians. Drivers yielded frequently on the entry lanes but not the exit lanes. Sighted participants accepted drivers' yields, whereas blind participants rarely did so. Blind-sighted differences are interpreted in terms of auditory access to information about traffic, and policy implications are discussed regarding accessibility of transportation systems.},

In our previous research, a position map matching algorithm was developed for integrating authoritative and crowd sourced road vector data, and showed promising results (Anand et al. 2010). However, especially when integrating different forms of data at the feature level, these techniques are often time consuming and are more computationally intensive than other techniques available. To tackle these problems, this project aims at developing a methodology for automated conflict resolution, linking and merging of geographical information from disparate authoritative and crowd-sourced data sources. This article describes research undertaken by the authors on the design, implementation, and evaluation of algorithms and procedures for producing a coherent ontology from disparate geospatial data sources. To integrate road vector data from disparate sources, the method presented in this article first converts input data sets to ontologies, and then merges these ontologies into a new ontology. This new ontology is then checked and modified to ensure that it is consistent. The developed methodology can deal with topological and geometry inconsistency and provide more flexibility for geospatial information merging.},

abstract = {Sighted people often have the best of intentions when they want to help a blind person navigate, but their well meaning is also often coupled with a lack of knowledge and understanding about how a person navigates without vision. As a result what sighted people think is the right feedback is too often the wrong feedback to give to a person with a visual impairment. Understanding how to provide feedback to blind navigators is crucial to the design of assistive technologies for navigation. In our research investigating the design of a personal pedestrian navigation device, we observed firsthand the ways that sighted people seemingly misunderstand how many blind people navigate when using a white cane mobility aid. Throughout our qualitative end user studies that included focus groups and observations (including couple-based observations with a close companion) we gathered data that explicitly shows how the language and understanding of sighted vs. blind pedestrians differs greatly and even how it can be dangerous when people interfere in the wrong way. From our findings we discuss why it is difficult for a blind person to navigate like a sighted person to ensure designers are aware of the difficulties and designing with new training in mind, not simply designing from their own point of view. We also want to encourage advocacy and empathy amongst the sighted community towards this activity of walking around independently.},

abstract = {Previous research has highlighted that blind and partially sighted people find various factors inhibit their abilities to make journeys. This paper proposes that the lack of accurate, appropriate and usable geographical data is one of the reasons for this and these can be tracked back to core human factors issues such as situational awareness, mental workload and environmental ergonomics. Following a review of applicable literature a hierarchical task analysis was performed to better understand the problems in terms of the complexity of various journey types and to identify the geographical data requirements in order to make successful journeys. The task analysis produced a number of results including highlighting four underlying principles which have an impact on the data requirements during any given journey. Finally the need for accessible and accurate geographical data requirements is introduced as a result of the literature review and the task analysis. These highlight the information required in order to facilitate more accessible travel for blind and partially sighted people by providing geographical information about their surroundings in a relevant, meaningful and usable way. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd and The Ergonomics Society.},

Successful travel requires that we know where to go and how to get there; it also requires that we can move along the intended route in the intended direction without having accidents or getting unnecessarily delayed. Taken together, these are requirements of navigation: coordinated and goal-directed movement through the environment. Navigation occurs over a wide spectrum of spatio-temporal scales. We navigate to the other side of the room, to the post office, to visit our relatives in another town, or to vacation half way around the world. In order to navigate effectively, we apply our psychological skills of perception, cognition, and motor behavior, within the contexts of physical and social environments, and with the assistance of technologies of information and transportation. There are consequently a host of human factors issues relevant to navigation. Attention to these issues can result in improvements to the design of technologies, environments, and training procedures that increase the ease, accuracy, efficiency, comfort, and safety of navigation.},

Tactile maps can provide them with spatial knowledge of their environment, thereby reducing fear related to travelling in space. To date, raised-line paper maps have been used to make geographic information accessible, but these paper maps have significant limitations with regards to content and the presentation of information. Recent advances in technology may help to design usable interactive maps that overcome such limitations. In this paper, we first review different accessible map concepts. We then present our design of an interactive map prototype, and provide evidence of this interactive map's high user satisfaction and efficiency as compared to a regular raised-line paper map. To conclude, we suggest that advances in interactive technologies (e.g., haptic touch surfaces) provide a unique opportunity to design usable maps in the near future.},

A lot of effort was made to improve the positioning indoor and outdoors, but affordable technologies are not accurate enough to navigate blind persons on a safe trip. The positioning should be improved by telling the user the surrounding environment. In example the user can verify the position of the sidewalk by telling him the location of the street and the buildings. The goal is the selection of a routing maschine which can deliver a safe route and additional trip information (i.e. crossings with acoustic traffic lights).},

abstract = {The use of spatial (geographic) information is becoming ever more central and pervasive in today's internet society but the most of it is currently inaccessible to visually impaired users. However, access in visual maps is severely restricted to visually impaired and people with blindness, due to their inability to interpret graphical information. Thus, alternative ways of a map's presentation have to be explored, in order to enforce the accessibility of maps. Multiple types of sensory perception like touch and hearing may work as a substitute of vision for the exploration of maps. The use of multimodal virtual environments seems to be a promising alternative for people with visual impairments. The present paper introduces a tool for automatic multimodal map generation having haptic and audio feedback using OpenStreetMap data. For a desired map area, an elevation map is being automatically generated and can be explored by touch, using a haptic device. A sonification and a text-to-speech (TTS) mechanism provide also audio navigation information during the haptic exploration of the map.},

As one might expect, the performance of blind individuals in many behaviours and tasks requiring imagery can be inferior to that of sighted subjects; however, surprisingly often this is not the case. Interestingly, there is evidence that the blind often employ different cognitive mechanisms than sighted subjects, suggesting that compensatory mechanisms can overcome the limitations of sight loss. Taken together, these studies suggest that the nature of perceptual input on which we commonly rely strongly affects the organization of our mental processes. We also review recent neuroimaging studies on the neural correlates of sensory perception and mental imagery in visually impaired individuals that have cast light on the plastic functional reorganization mechanisms associated with visual deprivation.},

This phenom- enon is known as volunteered geographic information (VGI). During the past decade VGI has been used as a data source supporting a wide range of services, such as environmental mon- itoring, events reporting, human movement analysis, disaster management, etc. However, these volunteer-contributed data also come with varying quality. Reasons for this are: data is pro- duced by heterogeneous contributors, using various technologies and tools, having different level of details and precision, serving heterogeneous purposes, and a lack of gatekeepers. Crowd-sour- cing, social, and geographic approaches have been proposed and later followed to develop appropriate methods to assess the quality measures and indicators of VGI. In this article, we review various quality measures and indicators for selected types of VGI and existing quality assessment methods. As an outcome, the article presents a classification of VGI with current methods uti- lized to assess the quality of selected types of VGI. Through these findings, we introduce data mining as an additional approach for quality handling in VGI},

abstract = {In this article we describe the analysis of 25,000 objects from the OpenStreetMap (OSM) databases of Ireland, United Kingdom, Germany, and Austria. The objects are selected as exhibiting the characteristics of “heavily edited” objects. We consider “heavily edited” objects as having 15 or more versions over the object's lifetime. Our results indicate that there are some serious issues arising from the way contributors tag or annotate objects in OSM. Values assigned to the “name” and “highway” attributes are often subject to frequent and unexpected change. However, this “tag flip-flopping” is not found to be strongly correlated with increasing numbers of contributors. We also show problems with usage of the OSM ontology/controlled vocabularly. The majority of errors occurring were caused by contributors choosing values from the ontology “by hand” and spelling these values incorrectly. These issues could have a potentially detrimental effect on the quality of OSM data while at the same time damaging the perception of OSM in the GIS community. The current state of tagging and annotation in OSM is not perfect. We feel that the problems identified are a combination of the flexibility of the tagging process in OSM and the lack of a strict mechanism for checking adherence to the OSM ontology for specific core attributes. More studies related to comparing the names of features in OSM to recognized ground-truth datasets are required.},

The specific research hypothesis is two-fold: 1) people with varied levels of vision loss and orientation and mobility (O{\&}M) skills will be able to form online social networks that collaboratively manage large route information collections for different geographic areas, and 2) members of such networks will be able to successfully travel through a variety of previously unknown indoor and outdoor environments of varied complexity when provided with online verbal route directions referencing landmarks and path integration information salient to their particular vision and skill level. In this paper, we report on the initial stage of our project: an online survey whose objectives are to collect samples of route descriptions from travelers with visual impairments and to do the initial profiling of the target population.

@article{Perkins2002,
abstract = {For this first of three progress reports on cartography, I am going to focus upon research into tactile mapping for visually impaired people, published since Fleming's (1990) review. This specialist field is often perceived as marginal to more mainstream cartography; production is often informal and receives no attention in Parry and Perkins (2000), the latest benchmark survey of the state of world mapping. Key themes in the tactile mapping community, however, reflect current concerns in the wider worlds of cartographic research. Six topics are reviewed here. How might spatial understanding differ among visually impaired people, and how might this be linked to map use? How does the 'real-world' practice of tactile map design vary according to context? To what extent has the increasing emphasis on standardization also applied to tactile mapping? How is technological change affecting tactile map production? Are hard-copy tactile representations still relevant in the digital and multimedia age? Finally, given the cultural turn in geography and more critical emphases among historians of cartography, how relevant are ethical issues in tactile map research?},

@article{Rivera-Rubio2016,
abstract = {Computer vision remains an under-exploited technology for assistive devices. Here, we propose a navigation technique using low-resolution images from wearable or hand-held cameras to identify landmarks that are indicative of a user's position along crowdsourced paths. We test the components of a system that is able to provide blindfolded users with information about location via tactile feedback. We assess the accuracy of vision-based localisation by making comparisons with estimates of location derived from both a recent SLAM-based algorithm and from indoor surveying equipment. We evaluate the precision and reliability by which location information can be conveyed to human subjects by analysing their ability to infer position from electrostatic feedback in the form of textural (haptic) cues on a tablet device. Finally, we describe a relatively lightweight systems architecture that enables images to be captured and location results to be served back to the haptic device based on journey information from multiple users and devices.},
